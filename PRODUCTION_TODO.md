# Production Deployment TODO List

This document outlines the remaining tasks needed before deploying the lottery ticket storage system to production.

## üîê Authentication & Security

### **Critical: Fix Authentication System**
- [ ] **Issue**: Currently using unauthenticated API calls (development workaround)
- [ ] **Problem**: AWS Lambda functions accept unauthenticated requests (security risk)
- [ ] **Solutions to evaluate**:
  - [ ] Option A: Configure AWS Cognito Identity Pool properly for unauthenticated access
  - [ ] Option B: Implement proper user authentication with Supabase + AWS IAM roles
  - [ ] Option C: Add API Gateway authentication (API keys, JWT tokens)
- [ ] **Decision needed**: Choose authentication approach based on security requirements
- [ ] **Implementation**: Update both Flutter app and AWS Lambda functions

### **API Security Hardening**
- [ ] Enable AWS API Gateway authentication/authorization
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement request validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add CORS configuration for production domains only

## üîî Push Notifications Setup

### **AWS SNS Mobile Push Configuration**
- [ ] **Create iOS Push Certificate** in Apple Developer Console
- [ ] **Upload certificate to AWS SNS** ‚Üí Create Platform Application
- [ ] **Set environment variable**: `SNS_PLATFORM_APPLICATION_ARN`
- [ ] **Test push notifications** with real devices
- [ ] **Configure notification permissions** in iOS app

### **Notification Content & Timing**
- [ ] Test notification delivery timing (4:15 PM Vietnam time)
- [ ] Verify notification content formatting
- [ ] Test both winner and non-winner notification scenarios

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure & Deployment

### **Environment Configuration**
- [ ] **Separate environments**: dev, staging, production
- [ ] **Environment-specific variables**:
  - [ ] API Gateway URLs
  - [ ] DynamoDB table names
  - [ ] SNS topic/platform application ARNs
  - [ ] Cognito Identity Pool IDs
- [ ] **Deploy production infrastructure** via Serverless Framework

### **Database & Storage**
- [ ] **Production DynamoDB tables** with appropriate:
  - [ ] Read/write capacity settings
  - [ ] Backup configuration
  - [ ] Encryption at rest
- [ ] **Data retention policies** for old tickets
- [ ] **Monitoring and alerting** for database operations

## üì± Mobile App Configuration

### **Production App Settings**
- [ ] Update API endpoints to production URLs
- [ ] Configure proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add analytics/crash reporting (optional)
- [ ] Test on multiple device types and iOS versions

### **App Store Preparation**
- [ ] Update app metadata and descriptions
- [ ] Prepare app store screenshots
- [ ] Configure app permissions and privacy policy
- [ ] Test app submission process

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### **End-to-End Testing**
- [ ] **Test complete flow**:
  - [ ] Ticket scanning ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Winner processing ‚Üí Notifications
- [ ] **Test edge cases**:
  - [ ] Network failures during storage
  - [ ] Invalid ticket data
  - [ ] Concurrent user scenarios
- [ ] **Performance testing**:
  - [ ] OCR processing speed
  - [ ] API response times
  - [ ] Database query performance

### **Security Testing**
- [ ] **Penetration testing** of API endpoints
- [ ] **Vulnerability scanning** of infrastructure
- [ ] **Data privacy compliance** verification

## üìä Monitoring & Operations

### **Logging & Monitoring**
- [ ] **CloudWatch dashboards** for:
  - [ ] API Gateway requests/errors
  - [ ] Lambda function performance
  - [ ] DynamoDB operations
- [ ] **Alerting** for system failures
- [ ] **Log aggregation** and analysis

### **Operational Procedures**
- [ ] **Backup and recovery procedures**
- [ ] **Incident response plan**
- [ ] **Maintenance windows and updates**

## üöÄ Go-Live Checklist

### **Pre-Launch**
- [ ] All authentication issues resolved
- [ ] Push notifications fully configured and tested
- [ ] Production infrastructure deployed and tested
- [ ] Mobile app updated with production settings
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed successfully

### **Launch Day**
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Watch for authentication/authorization errors
- [ ] Verify push notifications are working
- [ ] Check database storage and winner processing
- [ ] User support procedures ready

### **Post-Launch**
- [ ] Monitor user feedback
- [ ] Track system performance metrics
- [ ] Plan for scaling if needed
- [ ] Schedule regular security reviews

## üìù Notes

**Current Status**: Development phase with authentication workaround
**Next Priority**: Resolve authentication system (#1 critical item)
**Target**: Production-ready system with proper security

**Development Workaround**: Currently using unauthenticated API calls to AWS Lambda functions. This works for development but is not suitable for production deployment.
